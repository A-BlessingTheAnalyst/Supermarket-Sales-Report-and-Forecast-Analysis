## Project Overview
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of revenue trends and sales performance over consecutive years. Utilizing various analytical techniques, including comparisons between previous and current year revenues, revenue distribution across different product categories, sales distribution across geographic regions, customer-centric sales patterns, and daily sales trends, the analysis aims to provide stakeholders with actionable insights for informed decision-making.

## Data Sources
Supermarket Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is "supermarket_sales_data.pbix". It includes detailed records on sales by category, customer purchases, regional sales distributions, and other related metrics.

## Tools
PowerBI - Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, and Creating Dashboard.
This dashboard was developed using Microsoft Excel. You can download it from the [Microsoft Office Website](https://www.office.com/).

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

- Data loading and inspection
- Correcting misspelled values
- Removal of empty rows
- Removal of duplicated values
- Handling missing values
- Data cleaning and formatting

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the supermarket sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What are the total sales by year?
- How do daily sales trends look throughout the month?
- What is the total revenue and how has it grown over the years?
- How are sales distributed across different regions?
- Which categories generate the most revenue?
- Who are the top customers by sales volume?

## Results/Findings
Key findings from the analysis include:

- Sales have shown significant growth from year to year, with a total increase of 46.90% in revenue over the analyzed period.
- Technology products consistently generate the highest revenue among categories.
- The South region contributes the most to sales, followed closely by Central and East regions.
- Specific customers like Sean Miller and Tamara Chandler are top contributors to sales, suggesting potential for targeted marketing strategies.
- Daily sales exhibit variability, with certain peaks possibly indicating promotional impacts or seasonal trends.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Focus marketing efforts on high-revenue categories like Technology to boost sales further.
- Implement targeted promotions and loyalty programs for top customers to enhance customer retention.
- Analyze peak sales days to optimize staffing and inventory management.
- Expand product offerings in high-performing regions to capitalize on regional sales potential.

These recommendations aim to enhance sales strategies, improve customer engagement, and optimize operational efficiencies in the supermarket chain.
